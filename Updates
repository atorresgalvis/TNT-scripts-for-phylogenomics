**Report of updates**

*General updates*
  - Improvements to the dialog boxes of the scripts and improvements to the descriptions 
    available in the repository were made in 23th December 2020.

*SearchGeneTrees*
  - if you give the script a datafile with no blocks defined, an error is 
    triggered. (Tested on Win. FIXED) 
  - See screenshot of dialog. Some text goes out. (Tested on Win. FIXED)
  - Make frames for file names wider. (Tested on Win. FIXED)

*PhylogenomicSearch*
  - Some corrections in the output messages. (tested on Win. FIXED)
  - Some glitches in dialog box. (Tested on Win. FIXED) 

*GeneSupFrequency* 
  - opening script with no dataset in memory triggers an error. (tested on Win. FIXED)
  - same without a tree. (Tested on Win. FIXED)
  - errors turn off report! If user then quits program, it will save the report 
    as "off". (Tested on Win. FIXED)

*PhylogenomicSupport*
  - if user cancels datafile or treefile, the dialog is displayed anyway and 
    errors occur during execution. (Tested on Win. FIXED)
  - Some glitches in dialog box. (Tested on Win. FIXED) 
  - The script apprently runs OK but produces no output. User doesn't know what 
    to do; should he read the output treefile? (Tested on Win. FIXED)
  - Reading the output treefile causes an error (apparently branch labels are 
    missformed; if you get rid of the "| - \ -" in some labels, then the tree 
    can be read ok). (Tested on Win. FIXED)
  - The "resbremer" option was renamed as "combremer". (Changed made)
  - The "xboost" option was renamed as "FAR" (Fast approximate resampling). (Change made) 

*TreeDistMatrix* 
  - if you open this script without having read a dataset, it causes an error. (Tested on Win. FIXED)
  - if you open the script having read a dataset, and with trees in memory, 
    nothing happens --no output at all. (Tested on Win)
  - The order of the gene trees in the outputfiles is determined based on their distances to the reference
    tree. (Addition made)
