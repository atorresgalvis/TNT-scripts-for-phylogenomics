# TNT-scripts-for-phylogenomics
In this repository are included the scripts published in the paper *An outline for phylogenomic analyses using TNT* by Ambrosio Torres, Pablo A. Goloboff and Santiago A. Catalano (Cladistics. 2020).
The scripts are completely described in the study mentioned above. However, the entire information is also within the files themselves. In addition, this information could be accessed by typing in TNT (please make sure the script-files are in the folder where you are working):
